# Project1_PDB
Project 1 for Principle of Database Systems
The project is focused on:
* Writing a file based database system
* Becoming familiar with the need for a true database system

* Author: Eric Hansson
* Date:09/5/2023
* Platform: Arch Linux
* Any special steps to compile the project:
I compile the code with a makefile which creates a executbale called "exe"
* Any bugs with the program: 
If the ISBN number is 123456 and you try to add 123, it won't work as it find 123 in the sequence.
* Summary: 
For this project I first drew out how I would save the data in different files. After that I started to focus on
writing down the commands and what sub-commands they would have and what they would do. When I hade that done I started
to implement the commands and how they would add books, libraries, and holdings to the databases.
