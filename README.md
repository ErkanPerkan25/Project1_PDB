* Any special steps to compile the project:
I compile the code with a makefile which creates a executbale called "exe"
<br>
* Any bugs with the program: 
If the ISBN number is 123456 and you try to add 123, it won't work as it find 123 in the sequence.
<br>
* Summary: 
For this project I first drew out how I would save the data in different files. After that I started to focus on
writing down the commands and what sub-commands they would have and what they would do. When I hade that done I started
to implement the commands and how they would add books, libraries, and holdings to the databases.
